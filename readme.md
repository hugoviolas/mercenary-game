# Mercenary / Hugo VIOLAS

## What is this game ?

This game is inspired by the Beat Them All (BTA) genre born in the middle of the 80's, where the player must eliminate a large number of enemies spread over several successive waves.

## Key features

- Random enemy spawn on the map
- The "Big Enemy" class can follow the player and activate attack mode when in the area of the player.
- Different sounds are played when random actions are triggered.

## How could it be improved ?

- Make better player and enemies animations with better spritesheets
- Add death animations for each character
- Configure more waves
